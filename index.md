I am a multidisciplinary researcher in AI alignment, computer science theory, game theory, machine learning, existential risks, and applied rationality at the [Alignment in Complex Systems Research Group](https://acsresearch.org/) at [CTS](http://www.cts.cuni.cz/index.php?m=3&lang=en), Charles University, Prague.

In the past I have also worked on projects at
[Epidemic Forecasting project](http://epidemicforecasting.org/),
[Department of applied mathematics, Charles University](http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/),
[Algorithms group at ETH Zurich](http://inf.ethz.ch/),
[AIC at Czech technical university](http://cs.felk.cvut.cz/),
[Google Zurich](https://www.google.ch/) and
[CZ.NIC](http://nic.cz/).

My current research within the Alignment in Complex Systems group revolves around several overlapping themes at the intersection of AI alignment, game theory, and complex systems. These include, but are not limited to, active inference-based agent models, the interaction dynamics of large language models, hierarchical agency models, and ecosystem and biology-inspired models for agent systems. I also examine cooperation within games played on complex systems and networks, as well as models of bounded-rationality.

In addition to these current research interests, I have previously delved into topics such as graph theory, computational complexity, deep learning, artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, genomic algorithm application, epidemic modelling, and job scheduling.
