Independent researcher in AI alignment, CS theory, game theory, machine learning, existential risks and applied rationality.
Recently supported by [EA Grants](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/grants/) and [Open Philantropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/), in 2020/2021 worked on [Epidemic Forecasting project](http://epidemicforecasting.org/).

In the past I have worked at
[Department of applied mathematics, Charles University](http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/),
[Algorithms group at ETH Zurich](http://inf.ethz.ch/),
[AIC at Czech technical university](http://cs.felk.cvut.cz/),
[Google Zurich](https://www.google.ch/) and
[CZ.NIC](http://nic.cz/).

[<i class="ai black ai-orcid"></i> ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1119-2426) 

I am working on AI alignment, game theory, statistical physics applications, complex networks, machine learning, Bayesian modelling, and existential risk topics in general. 
My other and past topics include graph theory, computational complexity, deep learning, artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, algorithms in genomics, epidemic modelling, and job scheduling.

## SW Projects

I was developing several software projects, recently [Rain, a distributed computational framework](https://github.com/substantic/rain/) and [GameGym, a game theory library](https://github.com/gavento/gamegym), and several other reseach experiments.

### Student projects

I offer student projects and theis topics both on AI-safety related topics and all the others, aboth theory and implementation/experiments. There is an older [student projects page](/vyuka/projekty.html) (in Czech). Contact me if you are curious or interested.

I am coaching for [Effective Thesis](http://effectivethesis.com/), a good source of EA-aligned thesis topics and projects.

### Teaching
